# ✅ The GitHub Student Verification "Survival Guide"

**Getting rejected by the GitHub bot? You are not alone.** GitHub has significantly tightened their verification process to prevent fraud. This guide covers the "workarounds" and specific methods to get approved, even if you don't have an `.edu` email or a standard ID.

> **⚠️ Warning:** Do **NOT** use fake documents, Photoshop, or "inspect element" tricks. GitHub bans accounts for fraud. This guide focuses on how to present *legitimate* documents so the bot accepts them.

## 🛑 The "Golden Rules" (Read First)
Most rejections happen because you ignored one of these three rules.

1.  **NO VPNs:** You **must** be physically located near your campus. GitHub checks your IP address against your school's location. If you are on a VPN or Proxy, you will be auto-rejected.
2.  **Use Your Phone:** Do not use a desktop webcam. Use your phone's rear camera. It has better focus and provides metadata that proves the photo is "live" and not edited.
3.  **NO Scanned Documents:** GitHub no longer accepts PDF uploads or scanned images for most regions. You must take a **live photo** of the physical document.

## 🛠 Method 1: The "Context Photo" (Best for Rejected IDs)
**The Problem:** The bot rejects your ID saying *"Image looks manipulated"* or *"Can't read text,"* even though it's real.  
**The Fix:** You need to prove the ID exists in the real world.

1.  **Set the Scene:** Open your laptop and log in to your **School Portal** (Canvas, Blackboard, or your university's SIS).
2.  **The Setup:** Place your physical ID card **on the keyboard** of your laptop.
3.  **The Photo:** Take a photo that captures **BOTH** the ID card and the screen showing you logged in.
    * *Why this works:* It provides "Context." The bot sees the ID is physical (shadows, lighting) and corroborates the name on the ID with the name on the screen.

## 📅 Method 2: The "Missing Date" Workaround
**The Problem:** Your Student ID does not have an "Expiry Date" or "Current Semester" printed on it.  
**The Fix:** You must combine documents in a single photo.

1.  **Get a Dated Document:** Find your **Certificate of Registration (COR)**, **Study Load**, or an **Official Receipt** for the current semester.
2.  **The "Combo" Photo:**
    * Place the dated document flat on a table.
    * Place your ID card **on top** of the document (don't cover the date).
    * Take **one photo** showing both.
    * *Note:* Circle the date on the paper lightly with a pencil if it's hard to see.

## 🇵🇭 Philippines & Non-Standard Schools
If you are from a school (e.g., STI, AMA, State Universities) that uses `.com`, `.ph`, or provides no email at all:

### 1. Proof of Enrollment
If your ID is rejected, use your **Study Load** or **COR (Certificate of Registration)**.
* **Translation:** If your document is in Tagalog (or another local language), write the English translation on a small sticky note and stick it **next to** the relevant text (e.g., "Sy 2024-2025" -> "Current School Year"). Include the sticky note in the photo.

### 2. Location Issues (Dorm vs. Home)
If you are studying remotely (province) and your school is in Manila:
* **Enable Location Services:** Allow the browser to access your GPS.
* **Add a Comment:** When submitting, there is sometimes a text box. Briefly explain: *"I am a distance learning student living in [Province], attending school in [City]."*

## 📸 Technical Checklist (Before you click Submit)
* [ ] **Disable AdBlockers:** Extensions like uBlock Origin can block the location script GitHub uses.
* [ ] **Lighting:** Ensure there is no glare on the ID card (glossy plastic often reflects flash). Use natural window light.
* [ ] **Resolution:** The text must be readable when zoomed in.
* [ ] **Time:** Ensure your system time is set to "Automatic."

## 🆘 "I'm still getting rejected!"
If you have failed 3+ times, the bot might be "stuck" on rejecting you.

1.  **Wait 2-3 Days:** Don't spam the submit button.
2.  **Contact Support:** Open a ticket with [GitHub Education Support](https://support.github.com/contact/education).
    * **Subject:** "Manual Verification Request - [Your Username]"
    * **Message:** "My application was rejected by the automated system. I have attached my valid proof of enrollment here. My school does not issue .edu emails."
    * *Attach the photo you took using Method 1.*
