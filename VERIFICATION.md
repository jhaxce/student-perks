# ✅ Student Verification: The Complete Playbook

> **TL;DR:** Getting your student perks rejected? This guide covers every trick to get verified — from photo techniques to dealing with stubborn automated systems.

## 🚨 Before You Start

Most verification failures happen because of these three simple mistakes:

| ❌ Common Mistake | ✅ What To Do Instead |
|:---|:---|
| Using a VPN or proxy | Connect from campus WiFi or home without VPN |
| Desktop webcam photos | Use your phone's rear camera for sharper images |
| Uploading scanned PDFs | Take a live photo of your physical document |

## 🔧 Verification Methods

### Method 1: The "Context Photo" Technique

**Best for:** When your ID keeps getting rejected as "looks manipulated"

This method proves your ID exists in the real world:

1. **Open your university portal** (Canvas, Blackboard, or student information system)
2. **Place your physical ID card on your laptop keyboard**
3. **Take one photo** capturing both the ID and the logged-in screen
4. **Submit this single image** — it shows your ID is real and matches your account

> **Why it works:** The bot sees shadows, reflections, and lighting that prove the ID is physical. The screen corroborates your identity.

### Method 2: The "Date Combo" Technique

**Best for:** IDs without expiry dates or semester information

Many student IDs lack a printed date, which causes rejections:

1. **Find a dated document** — Certificate of Registration (COR), study load, or tuition receipt
2. **Lay the dated document flat on a table**
3. **Place your ID card on top** (don't cover the date)
4. **Take one photo showing both documents**
5. Optional: Lightly circle the date in pencil if it's hard to read

### Method 3: Manual Review Escalation

**Best for:** After 3+ automated rejections

When the bot is stuck on rejecting you:

1. **Wait 48-72 hours** between attempts
2. **Contact [GitHub Education Support](https://support.github.com/contact/education)**
3. Use this template:

```text
Subject: Manual Verification Request - [YourGitHubUsername]

Hello,

My student verification application was rejected by the automated system. 
I have attached valid proof of enrollment. My school does not issue .edu 
email addresses.

Account: [your username]
School: [your school name]
Country: [your country]

[Attach your Method 1 or Method 2 photo]

Thank you.
```

## 🌏 Region-Specific Guides

### Philippines 🇵🇭

Schools like STI, AMA, and state universities often use `.com` or `.ph` domains:

| Document | Use Case | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Study Load / COR | Primary proof for IDs without dates | Add English translation on sticky note if in Filipino |
| School Receipt | Alternative dated document | Must show current semester |
| Enrollment Certificate | Formal backup option | Request from registrar if needed |

**Distance learners:** Enable GPS location services and add a note explaining: *"I am a distance learning student in [Province], enrolled at [School] in [City]."*

## 📸 Photo Checklist

Run through this before submitting:

- [ ] **No VPN active** — Disconnect completely
- [ ] **Location services enabled** — Browser must detect your location
- [ ] **Disable adblockers** — uBlock Origin can interfere with scripts
- [ ] **Natural lighting** — Avoid flash glare on glossy IDs
- [ ] **Readable text** — Zoom in to confirm all text is sharp
- [ ] **Automatic time** — System clock must be synced

## 🔁 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| "Image looks manipulated" | Use Method 1 (Context Photo) |
| "Cannot read text" | Improve lighting, use rear camera, avoid shadows |
| "Date not found" | Use Method 2 (Date Combo) with dated document |
| "Location mismatch" | Disable VPN, enable GPS, try again on campus |
| Rejected multiple times | Wait 3 days, then use Method 3 (Manual Review) |
