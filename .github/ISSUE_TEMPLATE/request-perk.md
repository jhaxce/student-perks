Thank you for taking the time to improve this list. Maintainers prefer a small Pull Request to add or update rows in `README.md`, but if you'd rather open an issue instead, please fill out the fields below.

- **Type of request**: Add / Update / Remove / Other (choose one)
- **Category**: (e.g., Infrastructure & Cloud, Dev Tools, AI, Productivity, etc.)
- **Proposed table row** (copy-paste the exact Markdown row you want added or changed):

```
| **Tool Name** | Short description. | Benefit (e.g. Pro Plan) | **Free/Credit/Discount** | Student (Role/Req) | [Link](https://...) |
```

- **Source / verification link(s)**: (where maintainers can confirm this benefit)
- **Why this should be added / changed**: (one sentence)
- **Additional notes** (optional): screenshots, eligibility details, known caveats

If this is a request to change layout or ad behavior, explain why and include any screenshots; the maintainer will review and may request a PR or perform the change themselves.

Maintainers: if you accept this request, reply with next steps or convert this issue to a PR and assign it.
