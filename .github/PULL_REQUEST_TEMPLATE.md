# Pull Request Template

Thank you for contributing! To keep this project consistent and easy to maintain, all community contributions should only modify `README.md`.

Please use this checklist before submitting your PR:

- [ ] My change only edits `README.md` (no other files were modified).
- [ ] I added or updated a single table row (one resource per PR is preferred).
- [ ] I provided a source link or reference for the benefit/claim.
- [ ] I placed the new row alphabetically within the category where practical.
- [ ] This PR description explains what changed and why.

If you need to request a layout or ad-related change, open an issue instead and explain the reason; the maintainer will advise.

Thanks — small, focused PRs are easiest to review.
